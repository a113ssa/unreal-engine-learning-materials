The arguments you see inside the `UPROPERTY` macro are called specifiers. They define how the property behaves in various contexts. Here’s a detailed explanation of common specifiers and how to use them:

### Common Specifiers

- **EditAnywhere**
Allows the property to be edited anywhere, including in the Blueprint and in the details panel of the editor.
  ```cpp
  UPROPERTY(EditAnywhere)
  float MovementSpeed;
  ```

- **BlueprintReadWrite**
Makes the property readable and writable from Blueprints.
  ```cpp
  UPROPERTY(BlueprintReadWrite)
  float MovementSpeed;
  ```

- **BlueprintReadOnly**
Makes the property readable but not writable from Blueprints.
  ```cpp
  UPROPERTY(BlueprintReadOnly)
  float MaxHealth;
  ```

- **VisibleAnywhere**
The property is visible in the editor but cannot be edited.
  ```cpp
  UPROPERTY(VisibleAnywhere)
  UStaticMeshComponent* MeshComponent;
  ```

- **VisibleDefaultsOnly**
The property is visible only in the default settings of the Blueprint class.
  ```cpp
  UPROPERTY(VisibleDefaultsOnly)
  UStaticMeshComponent* MeshComponent;
  ```

- **Category**
Specifies the category under which the property will be displayed in the editor. This helps organize properties.
  ```cpp
  UPROPERTY(EditAnywhere, Category = "Configuration")
  float MovementSpeed;
  ```

### Advanced Specifiers

- **Transient**
The property will not be saved or loaded; it is temporary.
  ```cpp
  UPROPERTY(Transient)
  int32 TemporaryData;
  ```

- **Replicated**
The property will be replicated across the network. This is important for multiplayer games.
  ```cpp
  UPROPERTY(Replicated)
  bool bIsAlive;
  ```

- **SaveGame**
The property will be serialized for saving and loading game states.
  ```cpp
  UPROPERTY(SaveGame)
  int32 PlayerScore;
  ```

- **ReplicatedUsing**
The property is replicated and will call a specified function when it changes.
  ```cpp
  UPROPERTY(ReplicatedUsing = OnRep_Health)
  float Health;

  UFUNCTION()
  void OnRep_Health();
  ```

- **Config**
The property is loaded from a configuration file.
  ```cpp
  UPROPERTY(Config)
  int32 MaxPlayers;
  ```

### Combining Specifiers

Specifiers can be combined to fine-tune the behavior of properties. Here’s how you can combine multiple specifiers:

**Example**
```cpp
UPROPERTY(EditAnywhere, BlueprintReadWrite, Category = "Configuration", Replicated, SaveGame)
float PlayerHealth;
```

### Example Usage in a Class

Here’s an example of how to use `UPROPERTY` specifiers in a class:

**MyActor.h**
```cpp
#pragma once

#include "CoreMinimal.h"
#include "GameFramework/Actor.h"
#include "MyActor.generated.h"

UCLASS()
class MYPROJECT_API AMyActor :public AActor
{
    GENERATED_BODY()

public:
    AMyActor();

protected:
    virtual void BeginPlay() override;

public:
    virtual void Tick(float DeltaTime) override;

    UPROPERTY(EditAnywhere, BlueprintReadWrite, Category = "Movement")
    float MovementSpeed;

    UPROPERTY(VisibleAnywhere, BlueprintReadOnly, Category = "Mesh")
    UStaticMeshComponent* MeshComponent;

    UPROPERTY(EditAnywhere, BlueprintReadWrite, Category = "Configuration", Replicated, SaveGame)
    float PlayerHealth;

    UPROPERTY(Transient)
    int32 TemporaryScore;

    UFUNCTION(BlueprintCallable, Category = "Gameplay")
    void MoveForward(float Value);
};
```

**MyActor.cpp**
```cpp
#include "MyActor.h"
#include "Components/StaticMeshComponent.h"

AMyActor::AMyActor()
{
    PrimaryActorTick.bCanEverTick = true;

    MeshComponent = CreateDefaultSubobject<UStaticMeshComponent>(TEXT("MeshComponent"));
    RootComponent = MeshComponent;

    MovementSpeed = 600.0f;
    PlayerHealth = 100.0f;
    TemporaryScore = 0;
}

void AMyActor::BeginPlay()
{
    Super::BeginPlay();
}

void AMyActor::Tick(float DeltaTime)
{
    Super::Tick(DeltaTime);
}

void AMyActor::MoveForward(float Value)
{
    FVector NewLocation = GetActorLocation() + FVector(Value * MovementSpeed * GetWorld()->DeltaTimeSeconds, 0, 0);
    SetActorLocation(NewLocation);
}
```

### List of Other Specifiers

Here are additional specifiers that you might find useful:

- **EditDefaultsOnly** can only be edited on archetypes (e.g., default properties of a Blueprint).
- **EditInstanceOnly** can only be edited on instances of the Blueprint in the world.
- **BlueprintAssignable** the property is an event that can be assigned in Blueprints.
- **BlueprintAuthorityOnly** the function can only be called on the server in a networked game.
- **Export** marks the property as being an exportable sub-object.
- **Instanced** the property is an instanced object.
